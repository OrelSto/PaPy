This package is based on the work of Lehmann, 2004 "An algorithm for the determination of all significant pathways in chemical reaction systems"

Hort description of sub-packages:

i__user_model:
    It's the packages responsible of treating the model input provided by the user.
    It means:
        - The chemical reaction system
        - The reaction rates
        - The concentration of each chemical species
        - Threshold minimum rate of chemical reaction to discard pathways Rmin

o__cpa_output:
    This sub-package format the output of the Chemical Pathways Analysis Package in a readible way.
    Outputs are:
        - All pathways > Rmin in a text based format (JSON ?, specific?, ideas folks?)
        - Saving informational plots (Pie charts and stuffs?)

It works as follow:
